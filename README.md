#JavaScript Tooling
##Love Your Development Workflow


Let's talk about how we develop JavaScript apps. Toss aside Notepad and IEâ€”it's time we got serious about this. 
Chrome Dev Tools, Postman, Grunt, Bower, SASS/Stylus, Sublime Text, JSHint... the list of tools grows every day. 
Once you learn to love your tools and get cozy with the command line, you'll be churning out apps faster than you can say "cross-browser compatibility."

Note: These samples were prepared for the 2014 Esri International Developer Summit and are geared toward 
the demo theater format. For the accompanying slides, head over to https://github.com/jpeterson/js-tooling-talk.
